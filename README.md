# Home Library

### Description

This is a fun home project I build for my wife and I to catalog our books. As of "First commit, base web app" you'll see the bare bones for this where you can add, edit, delete and search for books. You can set up a SQL database if you want to store your input, but otherwise this is currently just a fun toy.

### To Do

Some EntityFramework components will be aded to help with more database setup, as well as a simple Docker Compose to spin up a postgres instance to write to. Once that is complete I will also create a docker script to containerize the entire app so it can be run easily from any device.
